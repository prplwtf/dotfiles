### Installation
Installing my dotfiles is pretty simple, if you have a little bit of Linux experience that is. Either way, download all my dotfiles and put them into your user home folder.

To finish installation, run `sudo bash ~/.scripts/dotwtf/.install`. If you run into any permission errors attempting to run this script, run `chmod -R +x ~/.scripts` and try again.

### Updating
To update your prplwtf/dotfiles with the latest version, run `dotwtf -u` to resync with the latest release. This is still work-in-progress and may not work for everything.

### Features
- Clean distraction-less status bar with tray support and system stats.
- One command for changing the desktop and sddm lock screen wallpaper.
- Fixes for the Windscribe and Junction applications.

### Installation
Installing my dotfiles is pretty simple, if you have a little bit of Linux experience that is. Either way, download all my dotfiles and put them into your user home folder.

To finish installation, run `chmod +x ~/.bin/mset;chmod +x ~/.bin/chwall`.

### Usage
**Changing the wallpaper.** Run `chwall <path-to-image>` and reboot or right click the calendar in the status bar.

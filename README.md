### Installation
Installing my dotfiles is pretty simple, if you have a little bit of Linux experience that is. Either way, download all my dotfiles and put them into your user home folder.

To finish installation, run `sudo bash ~/.scripts/dotwtf/.install`. If you run into any permission errors attempting to run this script, run `chmod -R +x ~/.scripts` and try again.

### Usage
**Changing the wallpaper.** Run `dotwtf -w <path-to-image>` and reboot or right click the calendar in the status bar.
